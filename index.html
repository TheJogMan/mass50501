<h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
The 50501 Movement is a national movement in which people across all 50 States show up to their respective capitals to peacefully voice their opposition to the Presidency of Donald Trump. It is a decentralized group without a strict hierarchical structure. This site was established by residents of Massachusetts to express solidarity with the greater national movement; but our affiliation with the national movement is informal. This is entirely a grassroots effort by individuals in Massachusetts.<br>
<br>
50501 is an all inclusive egalitarian movement.<br>
<br>
As it stands, the separation of powers outlined in the US Constitution are being eroded with each passing day by a compromised Judiciary, an ineffectual Legislature, and a ravenous Executive. Our aim is to form a coalition of like minded individuals from all walks of life who are united by our opposition to Project 2025 and America First, the dismantling of the Federal Government by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, and the fascist dictatorial ambitions of President Donald Trump.<br>
<br>
The goal of this site is to lower the barrier of entry from outside observer to participant, and from participant to organizer.<br>
<br>
Due to this mission, we expect discussion to foster unity. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are a Liberal, Social Democrat, Marxist, Feminist, Anti Imperialist, or a lifelong Civil Rights activist. You may be one of these things or you may be all of these things. We all stand united by our belief in egalitarianism, inclusivity, and the belief that democracy under siege should be protected at all costs. Enemies of democracy seek to divide us, we should not allow that to happen. In other words, leftist infighting should be checked at the door.
